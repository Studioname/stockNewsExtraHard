# When STOCK price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").

## STEP 2: Use https://newsapi.org
# Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually get the first 3 news pieces for the COMPANY_NAME.


## STEP 3: Use https://www.twilio.com
# Send a seperate message with the percentage change and each article's title and description to your phone number.
